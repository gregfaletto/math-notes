@article{Banerjee2008,
	Abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a Gaussian or binary distribution in such a way that the resulting undirected graphical model is sparse. Our approach is to solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added 1-norm penalty term. The problem as formulated is convex but the memory requirements and complexity of existing interior point methods are prohibitive for problems with more than tens of nodes. We present two new algorithms for solving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the Gaussian case. Our first algorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive 1-norm penalized regression. Our second algorithm, based on Nesterov's first order method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem size than existing interior point methods. Using a log determinant relaxation of the log partition function (Wainwright and Jordan, 2006), we show that these same algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood problem for the binary case. We test our algorithms on synthetic data, as well as on gene expression and senate voting records data.},

	Abstract = {Estimating covariance matrices is an important part of portfolio selection, risk management, and asset pricing. This paper reviews the recent development in estimating high dimensional covariance matrices, where the number of variables can be greater than the number of observations. The limitations of the sample covariance matrix are discussed. Several new approaches are presented, including the shrinkage method, the observable and latent factor method, the Bayesian approach, and the random matrix theory approach. For each method, the construction of covariance matrices is given. The relationships among these methods are discussed.},

@article{Fan2008,
	Abstract = {High dimensionality comparable to sample size is common in many statistical problems. We examine covariance matrix estimation in the asymptotic framework that the dimensionality p tends to ∞ as the sample size n increases. Motivated by the Arbitrage Pricing Theory in finance, a multi-factor model is employed to reduce dimensionality and to estimate the covariance matrix. The factors are observable and the number of factors K is allowed to grow with p. We investigate the impact of p and K on the performance of the model-based covariance matrix estimator. Under mild assumptions, we have established convergence rates and asymptotic normality of the model-based estimator. Its performance is compared with that of the sample covariance matrix. We identify situations under which the factor approach increases performance substantially or marginally. The impacts of covariance matrix estimation on optimal portfolio allocation and portfolio risk assessment are studied. The asymptotic results are supported by a thorough simulation study.},

Using a coordinate descent procedure for the lasso, we develop a simple algorithm-the graphical lasso-that is remarkably fast: It solves a 1000-node problem (∼500 000 parameters) in at most a minute and is 30-4000 times faster than competing methods. It also provides a conceptual link between the exact problem and the approximation suggested by Meinshausen and B{\"{u}}hlmann (2006). We illustrate the method on some cell-signaling data from proteomics.},

@article{Schennach2016,
	Abstract = {This article reviews recent significant progress made in developing estimation and inference methods for nonlinear models in the presence of mis-measured data that may or may not conform to the classical assumption of independent zero-mean errors. The aim is to cover a broad range of methods having differing levels of complexity and strength of the required assumptions. Simple approaches that form the elementary building blocks of more advanced approaches are discussed first. Then, special attention is devoted to methods that rely on readily available auxiliary variables (e.g., repeated measurements, indicators, or instrumental variables). Results relaxing most of the commonly invoked simplifying assumptions are presented (linear measurement structure, independent errors, zero-mean errors, availability of auxiliary information). This article also provides an overview of important connections with related fields, such as latent variable models, nonlinear panel data, factor models, and set identification, and applications of the methods to other fields traditionally unrelated to measurement error models.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops a general asymptotic theory of regression for processes which are integrated of order one. The theory includes vector autoregressions and multivariate regressions amongst integrated processes that are driven by innovation sequences which allow for a wide class of weak dependence and heterogeneity. The models studied cover cointegrated systems such as those advanced recently by Granger and Engle and quite general linear simultaneous equations systems with contemporaneous regressor error correlation and serially correlated errors. Problems of statistical testing in vector autoregressions and multivariate regressions with integrated processes are also studied. It is shown that the asympotic theory for conventional tests involves major departures from classical theory and raises new and important issues of the presence of nuisance parameters in the limiting distribution theory. ? 1986 Oxford University Press.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new algorithm, DASSO, for fitting the entire coefficient path of the Dantzig selector with a similar computational cost to the least angle regression algorithm that is used to compute the lasso. DASSO efficiently constructs a piecewise linear path through a sequential simplex-like algorithm, which is remarkably similar to the least angle regression algorithm. Comparison of the two algorithms sheds new light on the question of how the lasso and Dantzig selector are related. In addition, we provide theoretical conditions on the design matrix X under which the lasso and Dantzig selector coefficient estimates will be identical for certain tuning parameters. As a consequence, in many instances, we can extend the powerful non-asymptotic bounds that have been developed for the Dantzig selector to the lasso. Finally, through empirical studies of simulated and real world data sets we show that in practice, when the bounds hold for the Dantzig selector, they almost always also hold for the lasso.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce nonlinear regularized wavelet estimators for estimating nonparametric regression functions when sampling points are not uniformly spaced. The approach can apply readily to many other statistical contexts. Various new penalty functions are proposed. The hard-thresholding and soft-thresholding estimators of Donoho and Johnstone are specii c members of nonlinear regularized wavelet estimators. They correspond to the lower and upper envelopes of a class of the penalized least squares estimators. Necessary conditions for penalty functions are given for regularized estimators to possess thresholding properties. Oracle inequalities and universal thresholding parameters are obtained for a large class of penalty functions. The sampling properties of nonlinear regularized wavelet estimators are established and are shown to be adaptively minimax. To eff ciently solve penalized least squares problems, nonlinear regularized Sobolev interpolators (NRS I) are proposed as initial estimators, which are shown to have good sampling properties. The NRS I is further ameliorated by regularized one-step estimators, which are the one-step estimators of the penalized least squares problems using the NRS I as initial estimators. The graduated nonconvexity algorithm is also introduced to handle penalized least squares problems. The newly introduced approaches are illustrated by a few numerical examples.},

	Abstract = {Proposed by Tibshirani, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) estimates a vector of regression coefficients by minimizing the residual sum of squares subject to a constraint on the l'-norm of the coefficient vector. The LASSO estimator typically has one or more zero elements and thus shares characteristics of both shrinkage estimation and variable selection. In this article we treat the LASSO as a convex programming problem and derive its dual. Consideration of the primal and dual problems together leads to important new insights into the characteristics of the LASSO estimator and to an improved method for estimating its covariance matrix. Using these results we also develop an efficient algorithm for computing LASSO estimates which is usable even in cases where the number of regressors exceeds the number of observations. An S-Plus library based on this algorithm is available from StatLib.},

	Abstract = {The lasso is a popular tool for sparse linear regression, especially for problems in which the number of variables p exceeds the number of observations n. But when p{\textgreater}n, the lasso criterion is not strictly convex, and hence it may not have a unique minimum. An important question is: when is the lasso solution well-defined (unique)? We review results from the literature, which show that if the predictor variables are drawn from a continuous probability distribution, then there is a unique lasso solution with probability one, regardless of the sizes of n and p. We also show that this result extends easily to {\$}\backslashell{\_}1{\$} penalized minimization problems over a wide range of loss functions. A second important question is: how can we deal with the case of non-uniqueness in lasso solutions? In light of the aforementioned result, this case really only arises when some of the predictor variables are discrete, or when some post-processing has been performed on continuous predictor measurements. Though we certainly cannot claim to provide a complete answer to such a broad question, we do present progress towards understanding some aspects of non-uniqueness. First, we extend the LARS algorithm for computing the lasso solution path to cover the non-unique case, so that this path algorithm works for any predictor matrix. Next, we derive a simple method for computing the component-wise uncertainty in lasso solutions of any given problem instance, based on linear programming. Finally, we review results from the literature on some of the unifying properties of lasso solutions, and also point out particular forms of solutions that have distinctive properties.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a multivariate Bernoulli process with auto-regressive feedback in the high-dimensional setting where the number of samples available is much less than the number of parameters. This problem arises in learning interconnections of networks of dynamical systems with spiking or binary-valued data. We allow the process to depend on its past up to a lag p, for a general p ≥ 1, allowing for more realistic modeling in many applications. We propose and analyze an 1-regularized maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) under the assumption that the parameter tensor is approximately sparse. Rigorous analysis of such estimators is made challenging by the dependent and non-Gaussian nature of the process as well as the presence of the nonlinearities and multi-level feedback. We derive precise upper bounds on the mean-squared estimation error in terms of the number of samples, dimensions of the process, the lag p and other key statistical properties of the model. The ideas presented can be used in the high-dimensional analysis of regularized M-estimators for other sparse nonlinear and non-Gaussian processes with long-range dependence.},

@article{Kleinberg2015,
	Abstract = {Empirical policy research often focuses on causal inference. Since policy choices seem to depend on understanding the counterfactual--- what happens with and without a policy---this tight link of causality and policy seems natural. While this link holds in many cases, we argue that there are also many policy applications where causal inference is not central, or even necessary. Consider two toy examples. One policymaker facing a drought must decide whether to invest in a rain dance to increase the chance of rain. Another seeing clouds must decide whether to take an umbrella to work to avoid getting wet on the way home. Both decisions could benefit from an empirical study of rain. But each has differ-ent requirements of the estimator. One requires causality: Do rain dances cause rain? The other does not, needing only prediction: Is the chance of rain high enough to merit an umbrella? We often focus on rain dance--like policy problems. But there are also many umbrella-like policy problems. Not only are these prediction prob-lems neglected, machine learning can help us solve them more effectively. In this paper, we (i) provide a simple frame-work that clarifies the distinction between causation and prediction; (ii) explain how machine learning adds value over traditional regression approaches in solving prediction problems; (iii) provide an empirical example from health policy to illustrate how improved predictions can generate large social impact; (iv) illustrate how " umbrella " problems are common and important in many important pol-icy domains; and (v) argue that solving these problems produces not just policy impact but also theoretical and economic insights. 1 I. Prediction and Causation Let Y be an outcome variable (such as rain) which depends in an unknown way on a set of variables X 0 and X . A policymaker must decide on X 0 (e.g., an umbrella or rain dance) in order to maximize a (known) payoff function $\pi$(X 0 , Y) . Our decision of X 0 depends on the derivative d$\pi$(X 0 , Y)},

@article{Williams2019,
	Abstract = {Standard penalized methods of variable selection and parameter estimation rely on the magnitude of coefficient estimates to decide which variables to include in the final model. However, coefficient estimates are unreliable when the design matrix is collinear. To overcome this challenge, an entirely new perspective on variable selection is presented within a generalized fidu-cial inference framework. This new procedure is able to effectively account for linear dependencies among subsets of covariates in a high-dimensional setting where p can grow almost exponentially in n, as well as in the classical setting where p ≤ n. It is shown that the procedure very naturally assigns small probabilities to subsets of covariates which include redundancies by way of explicit L 0 minimization. Furthermore, with a typical sparsity assumption , it is shown that the proposed method is consistent in the sense that the probability of the true sparse subset of covariates converges in probability to 1 as n → ∞, or as n → ∞ and p → ∞. Very reasonable conditions are needed, and little restriction is placed on the class of possible subsets of covariates to achieve this consistency result. 1. Introduction. A strategy for developing variable selection procedures with desirable consistency properties entails exploiting some distinguishing property of the theoretical true data generating model. For example, standard penalized methods of variable selection within a linear model framework such as LASSO of Tib-shirani [21], SCAD of Fan and Li [9] and the Dantzig Selector of Candes and Tao [8] rely on the magnitude of the coefficients in the true data generating model being relatively larger than those of the other coefficients. Johnson and Rossell [13] use this property to construct nonlocal prior densities over all subsets of covari-ates (see also Rossell and Telesca [19] and Shin, Bhattacharya and Johnson [20]). The defining property of their nonlocal density is that it takes the value of zero for subsets containing a covariate with a zero-valued coefficient. We propose a more desirable way for eliminating redundancies from the sample space of candidate subsets which does not explicitly rely on coefficient magnitudes. That is, any candidate true model should be nonredundant in the sense that it},

	Abstract = {This book is concerned with recent developments in time series and panel data techniques for the analysis of macroeconomic and financial data. It provides a rigorous, nevertheless user-friendly, account of the time series techniques dealing with univariate and multivariate time series models, as well as panel data models. It is distinct from other time series texts in the sense that it also covers panel data models and attempts at a more coherent integration of time series, multivariate analysis, and panel data models. It builds on the author's extensive research in the areas of time series and panel data analysis and covers a wide variety of topics in one volume.

	Abstract = {Agglomerative hierarchical clustering is a popular class of methods for understanding the structure of a dataset. The nature of the clustering depends on the choice of linkage-that is, on how one measures the distance between clusters. In this article we investigate minimax linkage, a recently introduced but little-studied linkage. Minimax linkage is unique in naturally associating a prototype chosen from the original dataset with every interior node of the dendrogram. These prototypes can be used to greatly enhance the interpretability of a hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, we prove that minimax linkage has a number of desirable theoretical properties; for example, minimax-linkage dendrograms cannot have inversions (unlike centroid linkage) and is robust against certain perturbations of a dataset. We provide an efficient implementation and illustrate minimax linkage's strengths as a data analysis and visualization tool on a study of words from encyclopedia articles and on a dataset of images of human faces.},

	Abstract = {Cross-validation (CV) is often used to select the regularization parameter in high-dimensional problems. However, when applied to the sparse modeling method Lasso, CV leads to models that are unstable in high-dimensions, and consequently not suited for reliable interpretation. In this article, we propose a model-free criterion ESCV based on a new estimation stability (ES) metric and CV. Our proposed ESCV finds a smaller and locally ES-optimal model smaller than the CV choice so that it fits the data and also enjoys estimation stability property. We demonstrate that ESCV is an effective alternative to CV at a similar easily parallelizable computational cost. In particular, we compare the two approaches with respect to several performance measures when applied to the Lasso on both simulated and real datasets. For dependent predictors common in practice, our main finding is that ESCV cuts down false positive rates often by a large margin, while sacrificing little of true positive rates. ESCV usually outperforms CV in terms of parameter estimation while giving similar performance as CV in terms of prediction. For the two real datasets from neuroscience and cell biology, the models found by ESCV are less than half of the model sizes by CV, but preserves CV's predictive performance and corroborates with subject knowledge and independent work. We also discuss some regularization parameter alignment issues that come up in both approaches. Supplementary materials are available online.},

	Abstract = {Penalty-based variable selection methods are powerful in selecting relevant covariates and estimating coefficients simultaneously. However, variable selection could fail to be consistent when covariates are highly correlated. The partial correlation approach has been adopted to solve the problem with correlated covariates. Nevertheless, the restrictive range of partial correlation is not effective for capturing signal strength for relevant covariates. In this paper, we propose a new Semi-standard PArtial Covariance (SPAC) which is able to reduce correlation effects from other predictors while incorporating the magnitude of coefficients. The proposed SPAC variable selection facilitates choosing covariates which have direct association with the response variable, via utilizing dependency among covariates. We show that the proposed method with the Lasso penalty (SPAC-Lasso) enjoys strong sign consistency in both finite-dimensional and high-dimensional settings under regularity conditions. Simulation studies and the `HapMap' gene data application show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional Lasso, adaptive Lasso, SCAD, and Peter-Clark-simple (PC-simple) methods for highly correlated predictors.},

	Abstract = {Adequate selection of features may improve accuracy and efficiency of classifier methods. There are two main approaches for feature selection: wrapper methods, in which the features are selected using the classifier, and filter methods, in which the selection of features is independent of the classifier used. Although the wrapper approach may obtain better performances, it requires greater computational resources. For this reason, lately a new paradigm, hybrid approach, that combines both filter and wrapper methods has emerged. One of its problems is to select the filter method that gives the best relevance index for each case, and this is not an easy to solve question. Different approaches to relevance evaluation lead to a large number of indices for ranking and selection. In this paper, several filter methods are applied over artificial data sets with different number of relevant features, level of noise in the output, interaction between features and increasing number of samples. The results obtained for the four filters studied (ReliefF, Correlation-based Feature Selection, Fast Correlated Based Filter and INTERACT) are compared and discussed. The final aim of this study is to select a filter to construct a hybrid method for feature selection.},

	Abstract = {In variable selection, most existing screening methods focus on marginal effects and ignore dependence between covariates. To improve the performance of selection, we incorporate pairwise effects in covariates for screening and penalization. We achieve this by studying the asymptotic distribution of the maximal absolute pairwise sample correlation among independent covariates. The novelty of the theory is in that the convergence is with respect to the dimensionality p, and is uniform with respect to the sample size n. Moreover, we obtain an upper bound for the maximal pairwise R squared when regressing the response onto two different covariates. Based on these extreme value results, we propose a screening procedure to detect covariates pairs that are potentially correlated and associated with the response. We further combine the pairwise screening with Sure Independence Screening [Fan and Lv, 2008] and develop a new regularized variable selection procedure. Numerical studies show that our method is very competitive in terms of both prediction accuracy and variable selection accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Variable importance is central to scientific studies, including the social sciences and causal inference, healthcare, and in other domains. However, current notions of variable importance are often tied to a specific predictive model. This is problematic: what if there were multiple well-performing predictive models, and a specific variable is important to some of them and not to others? In that case, we may not be able to tell from a single well-performing model whether a variable is always important in predicting the outcome. Rather than depending on variable importance for a single predictive model, we would like to explore variable importance for all approximately-equally-accurate predictive models. This work introduces the concept of a variable importance cloud, which maps every variable to its importance for every good predictive model. We show properties of the variable importance cloud and draw connections other areas of statistics. We introduce variable importance diagrams as a projection of the variable importance cloud into two dimensions for visualization purposes. Experiments with criminal justice and marketing data illustrate how variables can change dramatically in importance for approximately-equally-accurate predictive models.},

@article{Li2018,
	Abstract = {Sparse models for high-dimensional linear regression and machine learning have received substantial attention over the past two decades. Model selection, or determining which features or covariates are the best explanatory variables, is critical to the interpretability of a learned model. Much of the current literature assumes that covariates are only mildly correlated. However, in modern applications ranging from functional MRI to genome-wide association studies, covariates are highly correlated and do not exhibit key properties (such as the restricted eigenvalue condition, RIP, or other related assumptions). This paper considers a high-dimensional regression setting in which a graph governs both correlations among the covariates and the similarity among regression coefficients. Using side information about the strength of correlations among features, we form a graph with edge weights corresponding to pairwise covariances. This graph is used to define a graph total variation regularizer that promotes similar weights for highly correlated features. The graph structure encapsulated by this regularizer helps precondition correlated features to yield provably accurate estimates. Using graph-based regularizers to develop theoretical guarantees for highly-correlated covariates has not been previously examined. This paper shows how our proposed graph-based regularization yields mean-squared error guarantees for a broad range of covariance graph structures and correlation strengths which in many cases are optimal by imposing additional structure on {\$}\backslashbeta{\^{}}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$} which encourages $\backslash$emph{\{}alignment{\}} with the covariance graph.

The clustered lasso method is proposed with the l 1-type penalties imposed on both the coefficients and their pairwise differences. Somewhat surprisingly, it behaves differently than the lasso or the fused lasso-the exact clustering effect expected from the l 1 penalization is rarely seen in applications. An asymp-totic study is performed to investigate the power and limitations of the l 1-penalty in sparse regression. We propose to combine data-augmentation and weights to improve the l 1 technique. To address the computational issues in high dimensions, we successfully generalize a popular iterative algorithm both in practice and in theory and propose an 'annealing' algorithm applicable to generic sparse regressions (including the fused/clustered lasso). Some effective accelerating techniques are further investigated to boost the convergence. The accelerated annealing (AA) algorithm, involving only matrix multiplications and thresholdings, can handle a large design matrix as well as a large sparsity pattern matrix.},

@article{Su2017,
	Abstract = {In regression settings where explanatory variables have very low correlations and there are relatively few effects, each of large magnitude, we expect the Lasso to find the important variables with few errors, if any. This paper shows that in a regime of linear sparsity-meaning that the fraction of variables with a nonvanishing effect tends to a constant, however small-this cannot really be the case, even when the design variables are stochastically independent. We demonstrate that true features and null features are always interspersed on the Lasso path, and that this phenomenon occurs no matter how strong the effect sizes are. We derive a sharp asymptotic trade-off between false and true positive rates or, equivalently, between measures of type I and type II errors along the Lasso path. This trade-off states that if we ever want to achieve a type II error (false negative rate) under a critical value, then anywhere on the Lasso path the type I error (false positive rate) will need to exceed a given threshold so that we can never have both errors at a low level at the same time. Our analysis uses tools from approximate message passing (AMP) theory as well as novel elements to deal with a possibly adaptive selection of the Lasso regularizing parameter.},

	Abstract = {Applied statisticians use sequential regression procedures to produce a ranking of explanatory variables and, in settings of low correlations between variables and strong true effect sizes, expect that variables at the very top of this ranking are truly relevant to the response. In a regime of certain sparsity levels, however, three examples of sequential procedures-forward stepwise, the lasso, and least angle regression-are shown to include the first spurious variable unexpectedly early. We derive a rigorous, sharp prediction of the rank of the first spurious variable for these three procedures, demonstrating that the first spurious variable occurs earlier and earlier as the regression coefficients become denser. This counterintuitive phenomenon persists for statistically independent Gaussian random designs and an arbitrarily large magnitude of the true effects. We gain a better understanding of the phenomenon by identifying the underlying cause and then leverage the insights to introduce a simple visualization tool termed the "double-ranking diagram" to improve on sequential methods. As a byproduct of these findings, we obtain the first provable result certifying the exact equivalence between the lasso and least angle regression in the early stages of solution paths beyond orthogonal designs. This equivalence can seamlessly carry over many important model selection results concerning the lasso to least angle regression.},

@article{Yu2013,
	Abstract = {Reproducibility is imperative for any scientific discovery. More often than not, modern scientific findings rely on statistical analysis of high-dimensional data. At a minimum, reproducibility manifests itself in stability of statistical results relative to "reasonable" perturbations to data and to the model used. Jacknife, bootstrap, and cross-validation are based on perturbations to data, while robust statistics methods deal with perturbations to models. In this article, a case is made for the importance of stability in statistics. Firstly, we motivate the necessity of stability for interpretable and reliable encoding models from brain fMRI signals. Secondly, we find strong evidence in the literature to demonstrate the central role of stability in statistical inference, such as sensitivity analysis and effect detection. Thirdly, a smoothing parameter selector based on estimation stability (ES), ES-CV, is proposed for Lasso, in order to bring stability to bear on cross-validation (CV). ES-CV is then utilized in the encoding models to reduce the number of predictors by 60{\%} with almost no loss (1.3{\%}) of prediction performance across over 2,000 voxels. Last, a novel "stability" argument is seen to drive new results that shed light on the intriguing interactions between sample to sample variability and heavier tail error distribution (e.g., double-exponential) in high-dimensional regression models with p predictors and n independent samples. In particular, when p/n → $\kappa$ ∈ (0.3, 1) and the error distribution is double-exponential, the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a better estimator than the Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) estimator.},

	Abstract = {Variable selection can be challenging, particularly in situations with a large number of predic-tors with possibly high correlations, such as gene expression data. In this article, a new method called the OSCAR (octagonal shrinkage and clustering algorithm for regression) is proposed to simultaneously select variables while grouping them into predictive clusters. In addition to improving prediction accuracy and interpretation, these resulting groups can then be investigated further to discover what contributes to the group having a similar behavior. The technique is based on penalized least squares with a geometrically intuitive penalty function that shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero. Additionally, this penalty yields exact equality of some coefficients, encouraging correlated predictors that have a similar effect on the response to form predictive clusters represented by a single coefficient. The proposed procedure is shown to compare favorably to the existing shrinkage and variable selection techniques in terms of both prediction error and model complexity, while yielding the additional grouping information.},

	Abstract = {We consider estimation in a high-dimensional linear model with strongly correlated variables. We propose to cluster the variables first and do subsequent sparse estimation such as the Lasso for cluster-representatives or the group Lasso based on the structure from the clusters. Regarding the first step, we present a novel and bottom-up agglomerative clustering algorithm based on canonical correlations, and we show that it finds an optimal solution and is statistically consistent. We also present some theoretical arguments that canonical correlation based clustering leads to a better-posed compatibility constant for the design matrix which ensures identifiability and an oracle inequality for the group Lasso. Furthermore, we discuss circumstances where cluster-representatives and using the Lasso as subsequent estimator leads to improved results for prediction and detection of variables. We complement the theoretical analysis with various empirical results. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Efron2004,
	Abstract = {The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward Selection and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied. Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we introduce fuzzy forests, a novel machine learning algorithm for ranking the importance of features in high-dimensional classification and regression problems. Fuzzy forests is specifically designed to provide relatively unbiased rankings of variable importance in the presence of highly correlated features, especially when p {\textgreater}{\textgreater} n. We introduce our implementation of fuzzy forests in the R package, fuzzyforest. Fuzzy forests works by taking advantage of the network structure between features. First, the features are partitioned into separate modules such that the correlation within modules is high and the correlation between modules is low. The package fuzzyforest allows for easy use of Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to form modules of features such that the modules are roughly uncorrelated. Then recursive feature elimination random forests (RFE-RFs) are used on each module, separately. From the surviving features, a final group is selected and ranked using one last round of RFE-RFs. This procedure results in a ranked variable importance list whose size is pre-specified by the user. The selected features can then be used to construct a predictive model.},

	Abstract = {Uncontrolled confounding in observational studies gives rise to biased effect estimates. Sensitivity analysis techniques can be useful in assessing the magnitude of these biases. In this paper, we use the potential outcomes framework to derive a general class of sensitivity-analysis formulas for outcomes, treatments, and measured and unmeasured confounding variables that may be categorical or continuous. We give results for additive, risk-ratio and odds-ratio scales. We show that these results encompass a number of more specific sensitivity-analysis methods in the statistics and epidemiology literature. The applicability, usefulness, and limits of the bias-adjustment formulas are discussed. We illustrate the sensitivity-analysis techniques that follow from our results by applying them to 3 different studies. The bias formulas are particularly simple and easy to use in settings in which the unmeasured confounding variable is binary with constant effect on the outcome across treatment levels.},

@article{McCandless-2017,
	Abstract = {Bias from unmeasured confounding is a persistent concern in observational studies, and sensitivity analysis has been proposed as a solution. In the recent years, probabilistic sensitivity analysis using either Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis (MCSA) or Bayesian sensitivity analysis (BSA) has emerged as a practical analytic strategy when there are multiple bias parameters inputs. BSA uses Bayes theorem to formally combine evidence from the prior distribution and the data. In contrast, MCSA samples bias parameters directly from the prior distribution. Intuitively, one would think that BSA and MCSA ought to give similar results. Both methods use similar models and the same (prior) probability distributions for the bias parameters. In this paper, we illustrate the surprising finding that BSA and MCSA can give very different results. Specifically, we demonstrate that MCSA can give inaccurate uncertainty assessments (e.g. 95\% intervals) that do not reflect the data's influence on uncertainty about unmeasured confounding. Using a data example from epidemiology and simulation studies, we show that certain combinations of data and prior distributions can result in dramatic prior‐to‐posterior changes in uncertainty about the bias parameters. This occurs because the application of Bayes theorem in a non‐identifiable model can sometimes rule out certain patterns of unmeasured confounding that are not compatible with the data. Consequently, the MCSA approach may give 95\% intervals that are either too wide or too narrow and that do not have 95\% frequentist coverage probability. Based on our findings, we recommend that analysts use BSA for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Copyright {\copyright} 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
