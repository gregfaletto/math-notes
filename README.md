# math-notes
I originally started creating these notes to prepare for the GRE Math Subject test when I was applying to grad school. Since starting grad school I've added to these notes with materials from my classes. 

These notes cover concepts, theorems, proofs, and worked examples from a variety of math topics, mostly topics relevant to statistics. Some sections are more of a summary of a topic, while others are fairly detailed.

The main file to look at if you just want to see the notes is **Math Review Notes.pdf.** The "Topics" folder contains the notes from the individual sections that make up the main file. The Latex files are included, so you can edit the notes for your own purposes if you like. Of course, please credit me if distribute these notes or a modified version of them in any way. I hope these notes are useful--let me know if they help you or if you have any suggestions to improve them!
