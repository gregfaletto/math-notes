# math-notes

First of all: The main file to look at if you just want to see the notes is **Math Review Notes.pdf.** The main folder also contains Latex files associated with the notes, a folder of images for the notes, and a folder labeled "Topics." The "Topics" folder contains the notes from the individual sections that make up the main file, as well as the associated Latex files. Sometimes I like referring to the pdfs for individual sections rather than the full Math Review Notes.pdf file since they're shorter, so they can be more manageable to work with. However, in some cases sections contain links to other sections in the notes. Those links won't work outside of the full document--in the pdfs for individual sections, those links will look like "??".

# Summary

These are notes on a variety of math topics, mostly topics relevant to statistics. I originally started creating these notes to prepare for the GRE Math Subject test when I was applying to grad school. Since starting grad school I've added to these notes with materials from my classes. 

These notes cover concepts, theorems, proofs, and worked examples. Some sections are more of a summary of a topic. In other cases, I took my in-class notes directly in this document, so those sections are fairly detailed.

The Latex files are included, so you can edit the notes for your own purposes if you like. Of course, please credit me if distribute these notes or a modified version of them in any way. I hope these notes are useful--let me know if they help you or if you have any suggestions to improve them!
